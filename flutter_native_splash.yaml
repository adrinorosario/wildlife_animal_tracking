flutter_native_splash:
  color: "#ffffff"
  image: "assets/icon/icon.png"
  branding: "assets/icon/icon.png"

  android_12:
    color: "#ffffff"
    image: "assets/icon/icon.png"
    icon_background_color: "#ffffff"

  # Optional: Background Image
  # If you want to try to match the Flutter splash exactly:
  # background_image: "assets/background_image.jpg"

  # For now, sticking to a clean white icon launch to transition into your nice header.
  # If you prefer the background image immediately, uncomment the line below and remove 'color'.
  # background_image: "assets/background_image.jpg"
