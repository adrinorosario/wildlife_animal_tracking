- [ ] Create user login options for apple and microsoft
- [ ] Fix the UI colour scheming and make it consistent throughout the app
- [ ] Run the app on android and fix any bugs that might lead to crashes or undesired behaviours

- [ ] Set up the firestore database to store user pins
- [ ] Set up the appropriate structure to store images and pin details according to priority and in a way that allows for faster querying and filtering
- [ ] Implement the feature that enables a user to view all the pins upto a certain radius from their current location
- [ ] Refine the feature that allows the user to add a pin to the database
- [ ] Redesign the pins to be more eye-catchy and unique (not generic like the red ones)
- [ ] User profile needs to be implemented where the user should be able to delete or logout of his account. Further options for validating a user's identity need to be thought over and finalised

- [ ] Architect the image processing pipeline
- [ ] Choose the model which will be used for fine-tuning
- [ ] Select dataset(s) and download them
- [ ] Fine-tune the model
- [ ] Train the model locally over a small subset of the original dataset
- [ ] Setup cloud environment to train and test the model
- [ ] Train the model in the cloud environment
- [ ] Test and evaluate model performance
- [ ] Integrate model into the system

- [ ] Write test cases for all the screens
- [ ] Write unit tests for all functions
- [ ] Write end-to-end tests for all features
- [ ] Write integration tests for all features

- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Set up automated testing pipeline
- [ ] Set up automated deployment pipeline

- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Set up error tracking
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring
- [ ] Set up security monitoring
- [ ] Set up compliance monitoring

- [ ] Brainstorm the new IoT integration process
- [ ] How will this new integration add more value to the existing offering and who is the target audience?
- [ ] Showcase how the information will flow across the entire system and where this new integration(s) will fit in
- [ ] What are the sensors we are using or targeting?
- [ ] Can those sensors be used in such real-world environments (in physical and feasibility sense)? As in, will they survive the real-world conditions and maintain optimal performance throughout their lifetime?
- [ ] Which features need to be developed to integrate these new sensors?
- [ ] What is the problem that the feature is solving and for whom?
- [ ] Simulate 3 scenarios and test the features
- [ ] What are the edge cases that these integrations need to consider?
- [ ] What are the bottlenecks these new features create for the existing features?

- [ ] Add a feature that allows the user to report inaccurate predictions when an image in uploaded
